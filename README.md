# c
A repository for learning C

This entire repository is simply me going through a series of exercises to further solidify my understanding of the C programming language. It is NOT a comprehensive demonstration, but as I learn, more will be added to it. 

All samples have been compiled and tested, and run without issue. However, I do not push the ELF files to this remote (for obvious reasons).

I will dedicate a repository for C projects in the future, so if you want to see more in-depth written programs, please reference my profile.

Stay tuned for more, and thank you for visiting my GitHub!
